2. Navigate to the folder where you installed the application. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   You can also use:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   or

   ```

4. Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will see the application in action.

### ✏️ Editing the Application

To make changes to the application, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the file `app/page.tsx` in your code editor. This file controls what shows up on the main page.

2. Modify the content to fit your needs. The page will auto-update every time you save your changes. This feature makes it easy to see how your changes look.

### 🖥️ System Requirements

To run the Next.js Template smoothly, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating Systems Supported**: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, Linux distributions like Ubuntu 18.04 or later.
- **Node.js**: Version 14.0 or later must be installed to run the application.
- **Browser**: A modern web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the application, here are some common solutions:

- **Check Node.js Installation**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can check this by running `node -v` in your terminal. If it returns a version number, you're good to go.

- **Firewall Issues**: Sometimes, a firewall might block the application from starting. Ensure that your firewall settings allow for local connections.

- **Port Conflicts**: If another application is using port 3000, you can change the port by running the command as follows:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- -p 3001
   ```
   Replace `3001` with any available port number.
